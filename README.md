# ZombieDice

A really simple Python script to show my son some code that does something "simple".

It's a Python interpretation of Steve Jackson's Zombie Dice. The rules for the game can be found at http://www.sjgames.com/dice/zombiedice/img/ZDRules_English.pdf.

This script has been written such that the entire game is completely customisable.
